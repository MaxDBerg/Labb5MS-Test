Further functions in the program include: Users can choose currency when creating accounts. The transfers between accounts with different currencies are done properly. The currencies are updated by the admins. Login attempts are limited to three tries and locks the user. The program saves the data from the program database in local textfiles, which can be read as a database. The changes are written down in the database between programr runs. The users must login using a unique username. The program looks good esthetically with clear menues, colorings and a designed ascii art logo.
